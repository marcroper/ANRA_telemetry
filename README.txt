The code which performs the telemetry data transfer is send_telemetry.py in the anra/ directory. The other file are the generated proto files.

The data files need a bit of explanation:

ANRA_telemtry120s.txt is 2-minutes worth of a telemetry data from a simulated flight starting at Crosshouse Hospital in Ayr and then heading north. This was generated by the high-fidelity simulation. This data is used for test purposes (rather than running the simulation each time), and there is some additional code which reads a line from this once per second and then writes it to the test.txt file, which is in turn read once per second and used to populate the payload to be sent. The "normal" set-up is that the high fidelity simulation writes to test.txt once per second (using this intermediate file was the easist way to get MATLAB and Python to reliably communicate).

From Akshav:

Find the modified telemetry code attached in the email. We have changed to send telemetry one by one
and have corrected the init method of the Payload class. It was successfully executed locally.
Please have a look and we can later set a meeting to resume the testing.
